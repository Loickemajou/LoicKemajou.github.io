## 🧬 Research Vision

My primary research interest lies in the **application of Machine Learning to real-world medical challenges**.I believe that **Artificial Intelligence has only begun to scratch the surface** of what it can achieve in healthcare — from accelerating diagnosis to personalizing treatment and improving patient outcomes.

My goal is to develop **interpretable and reliable AI systems** that support clinicians in complex decision-making tasks. Through this, I hope to contribute to **bridging the gap between machine learning research and clinical practice**, making intelligent healthcare systems more **accessible, transparent, and impactful**.
